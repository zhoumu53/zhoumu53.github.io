One large unexplained gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence is few-shot learning ------ currently deep learning methods use a large amount of data to do even “simple” object recognition tasks, which humans perform easily. This problem has amazed me for a long time, and therefore in my career, I have embarked on a path to build algorithms that learn with as little labeled data as possible. 

My goal is to understand what makes visual imagination possible in the brain, and the neural basis for learning and memory. My research interest is to build brain inspired AI, make AI more robust and less data hungry. I am excited to tackle such real-world problems with new algorithm development.

**Research interests**: Few-shot Learning, Domain Adaptation, Pose Estimation
